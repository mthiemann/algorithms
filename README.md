# Algorithms and Data Structures
A collection of personally programmed data structures and algorithms for quick lookup and reuse programmed in Java. Later, C++ solutions might be added.
Implementations can be found in the `src` directory and corresponding tests in the `test` directory.
For some algorithms no test cases are provided because these solutions already ran through test cases on websites such as Hackerrank or Hackerearth.


## Data Structures
From scratch implementations of common data structures in Java.
