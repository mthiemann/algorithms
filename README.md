# Algorithms and Data Structures
A collection of personally programmed data structures and algorithms for quick lookup and reuse programmed in Java. Later, C++ solutions might be added.
Implementations can be found in the `src` directory and corresponding tests in the `test` directory.
For some algorithms no test cases are provided because these solutions already ran through test cases on websites such as Hackerrank or Hackerearth.


## Data Structures
From scratch implementations of common data structures in Java including complexity for operations.
<br>

Data Structure | Implementation | Test | Add | Access | Delete | Optimized For
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Heap | [Heap.java](src/DataStructures/Heap.java) | [HeapTest.java](tests/DataStructures/HeapTest.java) | O(log N) | O(N) | O(N) | O(1) Peek <br> max (Max Heap) <br> min (Min Heap)
